                    The Suites at Barrington Woods is part of, and located in, the attractive Offices at Barrington Woods office park. Both the Suites, and the full office complex, are owned and managed by real estate investor/entrepreneur, and Barrington-native, Robert Gienko, Jr.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    Robert owns multiple office buildings throughout the Chicago suburbs and manages them all directly through his full-service property management company, Strategic Property Management, LLC. The Offices at Barrington Woods was purchased by Robert in 2011, and has since undergone a multi-million dollar renovation that has touched every part of the complex. As a result, the complex today boasts many high-end, modern, and stylish amenities and designs - and even includes many energy efficiency and other environmentally friendly upgrades. 
                    <br><br>
                    Understanding how difficult it is to start and operate a small business today, Robert recognized the need to create an office space solution that is both affordable and convenient for individuals and small business owners. As such, in 2013, he chose a premier portion of the Offices at Barrington Woods complex, and created the Suites at Barrington Woods to offer full service executive suites and other office support services.
